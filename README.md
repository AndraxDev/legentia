# Legentia

Legentia is just another way how to learn Latin. It is a simple app that helps
you to learn Latin vocabulary and grammar. It is designed to be simple and easy 
to use, so you can focus on learning. With AI-assisted features like real-time
reading you can practice your skills on real latin text. Additionally, you can
add your own learning sources and use it in the app.

> Currently, Legentia is in very early development.

### Author's motivation

I started learning latin since my last visit to Rome where I found a lot of
historical texts and inscriptions. I wanted to learn more about the language and
culture. Additionally, I decided to share my learning experience with others, so
I'm bringing this app to you.

This app is inspired by popular Duolingo app, but it has more focus on reading.
Duolingo has very limited latin course (about 500 words) so I felt to bring something
new to latin learners.

### Features

- AI-assisted reading
- Word practice list
- Word quiz
- Phrases practice exercises
- More features soon (planned to add daily streaks, achievements, library, online features, and more)
